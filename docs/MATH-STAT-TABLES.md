## Non-Tracked Bonuses

The following bonus types appear in effect text but are NOT tracked by the stat engine. An LLM should note these exist but cannot compute them through the formula system:

- **Element-specific damage** ("+30% Water damage", "+30% Flame damage" masteries) -- game-engine effects only
- **Boss damage** ("+20% damage to Bosses", "+30% damage to Bosses") -- situational, not tracked
- **Barrier damage** ("+50% damage to enemies with a Barrier") -- situational
- **Projectile reduction** ("Reduces damage from projectiles by 75%") -- defensive, not tracked
- **Astral power scaling** ("+5% damage per Astral power acquired") -- stacking with build composition
- **Element-specific offering rate** (artifact element boosters) -- meta/economy, not combat
- **Dash cooldown** ("-35% Dash Cooldown" masteries) -- timing effect, not tracked as stat
- **Guard Break** effects -- utility/crowd-control
- **Master Strike damage** (Leonardo Inspiration 1) -- specific to Leo's mechanic
- **Special charges** (Leonardo Inspiration 2) -- counted but not in stat engine
- **Casey Inspiration 2** (+33/66/100% Crit on next attack after Special) -- per-action proc, not stat

These bonuses are real and important for build evaluation but cannot be calculated through `computeCharacterStats()`.
